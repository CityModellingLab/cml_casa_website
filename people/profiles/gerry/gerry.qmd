I lead the Arup City Modelling Lab team, and helped found the CASA Arup City Modelling Lab at UCL.

### Education & Experience

Gerry spent too long in University. His original training was in Civil Engineering at Queen's University Belfast. He worked as a Junior Engineer in Port au Prince, Haiti in 2010 and then a stagiaire engineer in Paris, France in 2011 before doing an MPhil in Engineering for Sustainable Development at Cambridge in 2012. He did a PhD in simulation and carbon calculations at the University of Cambridge, before joining Arup. At Arup he started the City Modelling Lab, a team doing Research & Development on urban and transportation related use cases. We focus specifically on carbon and equity analysis.

## Fact File

I enjoy running and cycling (before it was cool).
