Adding a new blog post is fairly easy. You can use this .qmd file as a template for your new blog post.

### Steps to add a blog post

1.  Clone this whole github repo onto your machine - but create a new branch so you don't mess up the main branch. Message if you need to be added as a user to the Github repo. 
2.  Create a new folder in the posts directory
3.  Save a new .qmd file in that folder (for example post2.qmd)
4.  Fill the new qmd file with whatever you want to blog about.
5.  in the yaml header at the top, include a few bits of info:
* title: "Your title" 
* description: "your description" 
* author: "Your name" 
* date: today (or a chosen date in the format mm/dd/yyyy)
* draft: False (won't post it, True will) 

5.  If you want to include any images, add them into this folder too, and then insert:

6.  Save your .qmd file. Commit and push it back up to github.
7.  Might need to then make a merge request to merge back into the main branch - which will then render to the world.

### A few tips 

Quarto largely follows markdown formatting, links can be inserted like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), footnotes like this [^1]. You can also use html for more control over the design.
