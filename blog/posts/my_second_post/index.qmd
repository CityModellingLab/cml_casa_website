Adding a new blog post is fairly easy.

1.  Clone this whole github repo onto your machine - but create a new branch so you don't mess up the main branch. I may need to do something on github to add you as a user.
2.  Create a new folder in the posts directory
3.  Save a new index.qmd file in that folder
4.  Fill the new index.qmd file with whatever you want to blog about.
5.  in the yaml header at the top, include a few bits of info:

title: "Your title" description: "your description" author: "Your name" date: today (if you want to give your post today's date draft: false (true will not post it, false will)

5.  If you want to include any images, add them into this folder too:

6.  Save your .qmd file. Commit and push it back up to github.
7.  Might need to then make a merge request to merge back into the main branch - which will then render to the world.
